# COVID19 Data Analysis

### Overview 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this project, we are going to work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related
to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. 
We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.


### Approach
1. Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by cleaning the dataset. After prepared COVID19 dataset we will import worldwide happiness dataset and clean the dataset for analysis.<br/>
2. Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.<br/>
3. Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.<br/>
4. Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn.<br/>
